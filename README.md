## Intrinsic dimension of data representations in deep neural networks


This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the following paper

["Intrinsic dimension of data representations in deep neural networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12784). _Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019_

Morover we provide [jupyter notebook tutorials](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/tutorials) where we describe more in detail the methodology used and point to possible extensions and open problems.

We were largely inspired from the amazing repository ["(SV)CCA"](https://github.com/google/svcca) for the structuring of this README.

### Code Structure and Usage

[rephrase]
The [tutorials](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/tutorials) overview all of the main scripts, provide an example implementation, and also discuss existing applications and new directions. 

The main file is [intrinsic_dimension.py](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/IDNN/intrinsic_dimension.py) which contains the functions to estimate the intrinsic dimension and to perform the multi-scale analysis (block-analysis).
