## Intrinsic dimension of data representations in deep neural networks


![alt text](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/docs/figs/wrap_up.png)


This repository contains the code to reproduce the results of the following paper

["Intrinsic dimension of data representations in deep neural networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12784). _Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2019_

Morover we provide [jupyter notebook tutorials](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/tutorials) where we describe more in detail the methodology used and point to possible extensions and open problems.

### Usage

The main file is [intrinsic_dimension.py](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/IDNN/intrinsic_dimension.py) which contains the functions to estimate the intrinsic dimension and to perform the multi-scale analysis (block-analysis).


### Video Sources

To frame this research in a broader perspective we point to the excellent seminar given by Davide Zoccolan at
the [ICTP Workshop on Science of Data Science | (smr 3283)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO13-AHit6E)


### Results reproducibility

In order to reproduce the main results of our paper follow these detailed instruction [code_instructions.pdf](https://github.com/ansuini/IntrinsicDimDeep/tree/master/code_instructions.pdf)
